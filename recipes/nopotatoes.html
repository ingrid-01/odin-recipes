        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You know when you want to try a new recipe so you have a peak inside your fridge and cupboard. But to your complete surprise, you don't have the needed ingredients?</p>
            <p>Babe, me too.</p>
            <p>But this Suzie from '50s couldn't care less. She still went for it, and when it tasted bad, she blamed her friend.</p>
            <p>Let's learn from her and try her admirable antics.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Some potatoes, if not, rice</li>
                <li>Some paprika, if not, other spice</li>
                <li>A half can of tomato sauce, if not, a whole can of tomato paste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a pan to medium heat, and follow ya girl Suzie.</li>
                <li><em>I didn't have potatoes so I substituted rice.</em></li>
                <li><em>I didn't have paprika so I used another spice.</em></li>
                <li><em>I didn't have tomato sauce; I used tomato paste,</em></li>
                <li><em>A whole can, not a half can; I don't believe in waste.</em></li>
                <li>Check your result, and if bad, blame the person who gave you the recipe! (That's me!)</li>
                <li><em>A friend gave me the recipe. She said you couldn't beat it.</em></li>
                <li><em>There must be something wrong with her. I couldn't even eat it.</em></li>
            </ol>
