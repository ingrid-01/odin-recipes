Recipe Website -

This is my HTML project from The Odin Project, Foundation Course - HTML Foundations. 
I have learnt the basics of HTML and going to try to utilise all the skills, such as using the HTML boilerplate, unordered and ordered lists, and adding various links and images - into this "Recipe Website".
